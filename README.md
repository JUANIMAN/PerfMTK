## Overview

PerfMTK is a Magisk module specifically designed to optimize performance and power efficiency on MediaTek devices. With multiple profiles and advanced configurations, PerfMTK gives you complete control over your device's performance.

## Features

- **Specific optimizations** for MediaTek SOCs
- **Support for multiple CPU configurations** (dual-cluster, tri-cluster)
- **Power modes**:
  - `performance` - Maximum performance
  - `balanced` - Balance between performance and battery
  - `powersave` - Battery saving
  - `powersave+` - Extreme battery saving
- **Dynamic adjustment** of CPU and GPU frequencies
- **Advanced configuration** of CPU and GPU governors
- **Thermal control** with option to enable/disable thermal limitations
- **Memory optimization** with zram and swap adjustments
- **I/O improvements** with parameter optimization for UFS storage
- **Gaming enhancements** for a superior gaming experience

## Compatibility

- Device with MediaTek processor and Mali GPU
- Android 9.0 or higher
- Kernel version 4.14.x or higher
- Magisk 27 or higher installed

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Magisk installed on your MediaTek device
2. Download the latest PerfMTK zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/JUANIMAN/PerfMTK/releases/latest)
3. Flash the zip file through Magisk Manager
4. During installation, you can choose which components to install:
   - system.prop
   - post-fs-data.sh
   - service.sh
   - PerfMTK Daemon (may slightly affect battery life)
5. Reboot your device
6. Enjoy optimized performance!

## Module Components

PerfMTK installs only what you choose during the installation process:

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **system.prop** | Includes system property settings to increase fluidity |
| **post-fs-data.sh** | Contains settings for important components such as cpuset, vm, mm and sched |
| **service.sh** | Includes ppm and filesystem tweaks to improve overall performance |
| **perfmtk_daemon** | Background process that identifies foreground applications and applies energy profiles according to configuration |

> [!WARNING]
> The perfmtk_daemon runs in the background to provide app-specific profiles, which may slightly increase battery consumption. If battery life is your primary concern, consider using the module without this component.

### App-specific profiles with daemon

The PerfMTK Daemon uses a configuration file called **app_profiles.conf** (located by default at `/data/local/app_profiles.conf`) to assign specific profiles to different applications. You can modify it manually or use the [PerfMTK Manager app](https://github.com/JUANIMAN/PerfMTK-Manager).

The default content of the app_profiles.conf file is:

```
# Configuration file for PerfMTK Daemon  
# Format: package_name=energy_profile
  
# Default global profile when no application from the list is in the foreground  
DEFAULT_PROFILE=balanced
```

You can customize it to assign different profiles to your favorite applications, for example:

```
# Configuration file for PerfMTK Daemon
# Format: package_name=energy_profile

# Default global profile when no application from the list is in the foreground  
DEFAULT_PROFILE=balanced

com.tencent.ig=performance
com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact=performance
com.whatsapp=balanced
com.android.chrome=balanced
com.netflix.mediaclient=powersave
```

## Usage

### Via Terminal (e.g., Termux)

To see the complete menu:
```
su -c perfmtk
```

To change performance profiles manually:
```bash
# Maximum performance
su -c perfmtk performance

# Balanced (default)
su -c perfmtk balanced

# Battery saving
su -c perfmtk powersave

# Extreme battery saving
su -c perfmtk powersave+
```

For thermal limitation control:
```bash
# Enable thermal limitations
su -c thermal_limit enable

# Disable thermal limitations (be careful with overheating)
su -c thermal_limit disable
```

### Via PerfMTK Manager App

1. Open the [PerfMTK Manager app](https://github.com/JUANIMAN/PerfMTK-Manager)
2. Select the desired performance profile
3. Enable or disable thermal limitations according to your needs
4. Configure specific profiles for your favorite applications
